As a lightweight, powerful code editor and code runner, LINQPad can save a lot of time in your development workflow. Instructor Walt Ritscher walks you through installing and setting up LINQPad. Then start learning LINQPad basics such as adding course files, exploring the editors that LINQPad offers, running queries, and adding references. Walt goes into more detail on the dump tool, explaining topics like the dump helper, excluding and including columns, and changing output to grid control. Next, examine LINQ query examples. See how to format the output. Learn how to display the difference between two objects, snapshot the state of an object, and cache data between query runs. Walt also demonstrates how to use LINQPad as a code scratchpad. Then study how to debug query code in LINQPad. Learn how to find content in files, how to add visualizations to the result windows, and how to use the uncapsulate method.

## Description
LINQPad is a fantastic tool for testing.NET code snippets. Use its code editor and type a few lines of C#, VB or F# code in the editor and press run.  Instantly, see the results in the output window.  It excels at working with Microsoft LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and supports all flavors of LINQ (Linq to objects, Linq to databases, and Linq to XML).  With LINQPad you can test C# expressions, or full programs, in a lightweight code editor. It can be a great timer-saver in your development workflow.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
